# Write a program that greets the user by printing the word "Hello",
#   a comma, the name of the user and an exclamation mark after it.
#
# **Warning.** Your program's output should strictly match the desired
#   one, character by character. There shouldn't be any space between
#   the name and the exclamation mark. You can use `+` operator to
#   concatenate two strings.
